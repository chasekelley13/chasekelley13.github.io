# A Semester of Multimodal Work

### About Me
I am a senior at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in Political Science and History with a concentration in American History. Curious about varying disciplines, I have studied geology and global warming in the Alps, international relations in Jerusalem, and macroeconomics at the Stockholm School of Economics. This semester, I enrolled in Introduction to Digital Humanities to augment my understanding of how academia and social sciences are evolving with technology. Throughout the semester, the course has challenged my previous conceptions and led me to refine my skills across different interfaces and modes.
