This course has inspired me to further my understanding of digital landscapes, skills, and humanities. Following the course, I plan to

Develop a better understanding of coding, Python specifically. My previous experience with the coding language was to identify users who had unfollowed me on Instagram. I created a line of code that could compare two lists efficiently, especially useful when comparing two large data sets. However, this course has exposed me to the sheer complexity and capacity of code, and I want to explore the language to heighten my research capabilities. 

Additionally, I want to enroll in Data Sciences for the Humanities. Professor Porter’s presentation on AI was deeply intriguing. There are so many contemporary questions that have yet to be explored regarding this novel technology. I would love to take his course and challenge my understanding of AI’s capabilities and its intersection with academia. 

Finally, I will review my previous digitization work for the Lone Star Slavery Project. When working on the project, I transcribed and digitized 10+ documents from Brazoria County, creating metadata and tags. However, I did not have a comprehensive knowledge of tagging digital works. Therefore, I want to review the metadata I produced to ensure its effectiveness in describing and flagging the works.
